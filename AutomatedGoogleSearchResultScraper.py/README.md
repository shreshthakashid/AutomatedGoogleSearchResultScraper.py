# Automated-Google-Search-Result-Scraper

An automated tool that performs Google searches and extracts the top search results, including titles, URLs, and descriptions. This project can be useful for research, SEO analysis, and gathering insights from search engine results.

# Features
  Automated Google Search: Programmatically performs searches using predefined keywords.
  Extract Top Search Results: Scrapes the titles, links, and snippets of the top results from Google.
  Customizable: Easily configure the search term, number of results, and other parameters.
  CSV Export: Optionally, export the search results to a CSV file for further analysis.
  Error Handling: Built-in checks for handling exceptions, like CAPTCHA challenges or missing elements.

# Tech Stack
  Python: The main programming language for scripting.
  Selenium: A browser automation tool used to scrape Google search results.
  BeautifulSoup: A Python library for parsing HTML and extracting data.
  Pandas: For organizing and exporting the results to CSV format.

# How It Works
  Search Input: The tool takes a search query (keywords) from the user.
  Perform Google Search: Using Selenium, the tool automates a web browser to perform a Google search for the inputted query.
  Extract Results: The tool extracts the titles, URLs, and descriptions of the top search results using BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML.
  Export to CSV: Optionally, the results can be saved to a CSV file for analysis.
  Error Handling: The tool checks for common issues, such as CAPTCHA or missing elements, and attempts to handle them gracefully.

# Installation and Setup
1. Create a Virtual Environment
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate     # On macOS/Linux
  venv\Scripts\activate        # On Windows

2. Install Dependencies
  Install the necessary libraries by running:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download WebDriver
  You will need to download a WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) to allow Selenium to control the browser.
  You can download it from the official ChromeDriver site.
  Ensure that the WebDriver is compatible with your version of Google Chrome and add its path to your system's environment variables.
